# Building an IE8 Linter

To get started we need to add `ress` to our dependencies. I am also going to add `serde`, `serde_derive` and `toml` because I want to list of unavailable tokens to be configurable.

> Cargo.toml
```toml
{{#include ../../lint-ie8/Cargo.toml}}
```
Next we want to use the `Scanner` and `Token` from `ress`.

```rust
{{#include ../../lint-ie8/src/main.rs:1:6}}
```
Since I want to use a `.toml` file to provide the list of banned tokens, let's create a struct that will represent our configuration.

```rust
{{#include ../../lint-ie8/src/main.rs:14:20}}
```

The toml file we are going to use is pretty big so I am not going to list it here. If you want to see what it looks like you can check it out [here](https://github.com/freemasen/rusty-ecma-book/). Essentially it is a list of identifiers, strings, punctuation and keywords that would cause an error when trying to run in IE8.

To start we need to deserialize that file, we can do that with the `std::fs::read_to_string` and `toml::from_str` functions.

```rust
{{#include ../../lint-ie8/src/main.rs:23:24}}
```

Now that we have a list of tokens that should not be included in our javascript, let's get the javascript. I want this utility to be able to take a path argument or read the raw js from stdin. The function will check for an argument first and fallback to reading from stdin, it looks something like this.

```rust
{{#include ../../lint-ie8/src/main.rs:47:61}}
```

we will call it like this

```rust
{{#include ../../lint-ie8/src/main.rs:25:38}}
```
