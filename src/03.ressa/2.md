To simplify things, we are just going to lift the technique for getting the JavaScript text from the [ress example](../02.ress/2.html), so we won't be covering that again.

With that out of the way let's take a look at the `Cargo.toml` and `use` statements for our program.

```toml
{{#include ../../console_logify/Cargo.toml}}
```

```rust
{{#include ../../console_logify/src/main.rs:1:11}}
```

This will make sure that all of the items we will need from `ressa` and `resast` are in scope. Now we can start defining our method for inserting the debug logging into any functions that we find. To start we are going to create a function that will generate a new `ProgramPart::Stmt` that will represent our call to `console.log` which might look like this.

```rust
{{#include ../../console_logify/src/main.rs:218:232}}
```

We need to make the arguments configurable so we can insert the context information for each instance of a function but otherwise it is a pretty straight forward. Now that we have that, we need to start digging into the `ProgramPart` to identify anything we want to modify. Since `Parser` implements `Iterator` and its `Item` is `Result<ProgramPart, Error>` we first need to use `filter_map` to extract the `ProgramPart` from the result. It would probably be good to handle the error case here but for the sake of simplicity we are going to skip any errors. Now that we have an `Iterator` over `ProgramPart`s we can use `map` to update each part. 
```rust
fn main() {
    let js = get_js().expect("Unable to get JavaScript");
    let parser = Parser::new(&js).expect("Unable to construct parser");
    for part in parser.filter_map(|p| p.ok()).map(map_part) {
        //FIXME: Write updated program part to somewhere
    }
}
```
With that in mind the entry point is going to be a function that takes a `ProgramPart` and returns a new `ProgramPart`. It might look like this

```rust
{{#include ../../console_logify/src/main.rs:27:34}}
```

We are going to match on the part provided and either return that part if it is a `Directive` or if it isn't we need to investigate further to discover if it is a function or not. We do that in two places `map_decl` and `map_stmt` both of which are going to utilize similar method for digging further into the tree.

```rust
{{#include ../../console_logify/src/main.rs:35:49}}
```

There are two ways for a `Decl` to resolve into a function or method and that is with the `Function` and `Class` variants while a `Stmt` can end up there if it is an `Expr`. When we include `map_expr` we see that there are cases for both `Function` and `Class` in the `Expr` enum. That means once we get past those we will be handling the rest in the exact same way.

```rust
{{#include ../../console_logify/src/main.rs:50:57}}
```

Finally we are going to start manipulating the AST in `map_func`.

```rust
{{#include ../../console_logify/src/main.rs:58:79}}
```

The first thing we are going to do is to clone the `func` to give us a mutable version. Next we are going to check if the `id` is `Some`, if it is we can add that name to our `console.log` arguments. Now function arguments can be pretty complicated, to try and keep things simple we are going to only worry about the ones that are either `Expr::Ident` or `Pat::Identifier`. To build something more robust it might be good to include destructured arguments or arguments with default values but for this example we are just going to keep it simple.

First we are going to `filter_map` the `func.params` to only get the items that ultimately resolve to `Identifer`s, at that point we can wrap all of these identifiers in an `Expr::Ident` and add them to the `console.log` args. Now we can simply insert the result of passing those args to `console_log` at the first position of the `func.body`. Because functions can appear in the body of other functions we also want to map all of the `func.body` program parts. Once that has completed we can return the updated `func` to the caller.

The next thing we are going to want to deal with is `Class`, we want to insert console.log into the top of each method on a class. This is a bit unique because we also want to provide the name of that class (if it exists) as the first argument to console.log. That might look like this.

```rust
{{#include ../../console_logify/src/main.rs:78:184}}
```

Here we have two functions, the first pulls out the id from the provided class or uses an empty string of it doesn't exist. We then just pass that off to `map_class_prop` which will handle all of the different types of properties a class can have. The first thing this does is map the `prefix` into the right format, so a call to `new Thing()` would print `new Thing`, or a get method would print `Thing get` before the method name. Next we take a look at the `property.key`, this will provide us with the name of our function, but according to the specification a class property key can be an identifier, a literal value, or a pattern, so we need to figure out what the name of this method is by digging into that value. First in the case that it is an ident we want to add it to the args, unless it is the value `constructor` because we already put the `new` keyword in that one. Next we can pull out the literal values and add those as they appear. Lastly we will only handle the pattern case when it is a `Pat::Identifier` otherwise we will just skip it. Now to get the parameter names from the method definition we need to look at the `property.value` which should always be an `Expr::Function`. Once we match on that we simply repeat the process of `map_function` pulling the args out but only when they are `Ident`s and then passing that along to `console_log` and inserting that `Expr` at the top of the function body.

At this point we have successfully updated our AST to include a call to `console.log` at the top of each function and method in our code. Now the big question is how do we write that out to a file. This problem is not a small one, in the next section we are going to cover a third crate `resw` that we can use to finish this project.
